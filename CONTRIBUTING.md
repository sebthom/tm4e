## 🆕 Trying latest builds

Latest builds, for testing, can usually be found at `https://download.eclipse.org/tm4e/snapshots/` .


## 🧑‍💻 Developer resources

### ⌨️ Setting up the Development Environment manually

* Download and install the **Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers** from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ or another Eclipse installation with the [Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)](https://www.eclipse.org/pde/) installed.
* Clone this repository <a href="https://mickaelistria.github.io/redirctToEclipseIDECloneCommand/redirect.html"><img src="https://mickaelistria.github.io/redirctToEclipseIDECloneCommand/cloneToEclipseBadge.png" alt="Clone to Eclipse IDE"/></a>.
* _File > Open Projects from Filesystem..._ , select the path to the tm4e Git repo and the relevant children projects you want to import

### 🏗️ Build

Prerequisite: Latest Maven release or Eclipse [m2e](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/).

1. From the command line: run `mvn clean verify`
1. From within Eclipse : right-click on the tm4e root folder > Run As > Maven build

#### Running the CI job locally:

The GitHub actions wokflow is compatible with [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) a command-line tool that allows you to run GitHub action workflows locally.

1. Install docker
1. Install [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
1. From the commandline navigate into the tm4e rpoject root
1. Run the command `act`
1. On subsequent re-runs you can use `act -r` to reuse previous container which avoids reinstallation system packages and reduces build time.

In case of build failures the docker container will still be running and you can ssh into it for analysis using `docker exec -u root -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash`, e.g.:
```bash
container_id=$(docker container ps --filter status=running --filter name=act-Build-build --format {{.ID}})
docker exec -u root -it $container_id /bin/bash
```

### ⬆️ Version bump

tm4e tries to use OSGi Semantic Version (to properly expose its API contracts and breakage) and Reproducible Version Qualifiers (to minimize the avoid producing multiple equivalent artifacts for identical source).
This requires the developer to manually bump version from time to time. Somes rules are that:

* Versions are bumped on a __per module grain__ (bump version of individual bundles/features one by one when necessary), __DON'T bump version of parent pom, nor of other modules you don't change__
* __Versions are bumped maximum once per release__ (don't bump versions that were already bumped since last release)
* __Don't bump versions of what you don't change__
* __Bump version of the bundles you're modifying only if it's their 1st change since last release__
* Version bump may need to be cascaded to features that *include* the artifact you just changed, and then to features that *include* such features and so on (unless the version of those features were already bumped since last release).

The delta for version bumps are:

* `+0.0.1` (next micro) for a bugfix, or an internal change that doesn't surface to APIs
* `+0.1.0` (next minor) for an API addition
* `+1.0.0` (next major) for an API breakage (needs to be discussed on the mailing-list first)
* If some "smaller" bump already took place, you can replace it with your "bigger one". Eg, if last release has org.eclipse.tm4e 0.4.1; and someone already bumped version to 0.4.2 (for an internal change) and you're adding a new API, then you need to change version to 0.5.0.
