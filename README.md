# Eclipse tm4e - TextMate and language-configuration support for Java and in Eclipse IDE

[![Build Status](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/eclipse/tm4e.svg?color=blue)](LICENSE)

TM4E brings Java API to tokenize textual documents according to TextMate grammars with an Eclipse IDE client that can do syntax highlighting according to this tokenization; and Eclipse IDE client for VSCode [Language Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.languages) to support matching bracket, auto close, on enter support.

`tm4e` is an [official Eclipse.org project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e) so it conforms to typical Eclipse.org requirements and guarantees.

## üì• Install

### in Eclipse IDE or RCP applications

You can install `tm4e` with the update site [https://download.eclipse.org/tm4e/snapshots/](https://download.eclipse.org/tm4e/snapshots/). TM4E is usually installed together with its consumers, so end-user should usually not need to directly install it.

### as a Java API with Maven

The following class and modules should be used as entry point provides:

 * [org.eclipse.tm4e.core](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.core) provides the Java TextMate tokenizer. This project is a Java port of [vscode-textmate](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-textmate) written in TypeScript. This Java API can be used with any Java UI Toolkit (Swing, Eclipse, etc). See [Core](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/wiki/Core) section for more information.

 * [org.eclipse.tm4e.ui](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.ui) provides the Eclipse **org.eclipse.jface.text.presentation.IPresentationReconciler** [TMPresentationReconciler](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/blob/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/tm4e/ui/text/TMPresentationReconciler.java) which is able to tokenize an editor content by using a given JSON, PList TextMate grammar and do syntax coloration. See [UI](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/wiki/UI) section for more information.

 * [org.eclipse.tm4e.languageconfiguration](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.languageconfiguration) provides the VSCode [Language Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.languages) to support matching bracket, auto close, on enter support with a simple **language-configuration.json**.
